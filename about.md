I like math, golf, home improvement projects, and my black lab Zoltan. (Also my wife)

From linkedin:

Ph.D. applied mathematics student at North Carolina State University with teaching and research experience. I have been a teaching assistant for two semesters. My research uses computer models and simulations to draw out the governing dynamics of biological systems. Specifically, I am working to develop an agent-based model that regulates tumor cells' growth and interactive forces.
